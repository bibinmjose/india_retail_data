# Background
The retail prices of key commodities are sourced from Open Government Data platform of India. The dataset contains retail prices for key commodities recorded at around 75 key market centres in India. The granularity of the data is at day level.

## Data Dictionary
```
date : Date the retail price was recorded
centre : One of the 75 regional centres where the prices are recorded
commodity: Name of the commodity
price_per_kg: Price per Kilogram
region: The region of the country, the centre belongs to
country: Name of the country
```

# Questions to answer
 - Provide exploratory data analysis(EDA) of raw data. This should include visualizations and insights gathered from each visualization. Find this **[example](https://bibinmjose.github.io/dsgramner/ipython_md/analysis.html)**. Include correlation plots as well.
 - Afterwards, create a distilled version of the EDA with most significant insights. Find the progression of our **[example](https://bibinmjose.github.io/dsgramner/)**.
 - Can you pose 4 questions based on your EDA and answer them using satistical tests?
 - Create a regression model which predicts future prices with a confidence band. You may create/add new features based on the dataset as well as external sources (include source reference). Make sure you split the data into train, validation and test while training.
 - Tune the model to achieve [MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) of less than <50 on your test data.
 - Find the most important features from your model and substantiate. 
 - Finally, create a visualization overlaying your predictions with raw data.
